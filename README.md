# Pay attention:

#### Models have some comments to explain my thoughts.

#### I think `services` layer can help to make entire app more like "module" rather than MVC application, but that's not a big deal right now, we can go with plain models+controllers usage or use services in controllers.

#### I'm not good enough in naming, please don't mind that.
